            Foods rich in Vitamin A: Sweet potatoes, carrots, spinach, pumpkin, mango, papaya, apricots, eggs, milk, cheese.
            Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy vision, skin, and mucous membranes. 
            It is also important for immune function and growth and development. Vitamin A is found in both animal and plant sources, 
            with the most bioavailable form being retinol from animal sources. Deficiency of vitamin A can lead to vision problems, 
            weakened immunity, and other health issues.

            Iron: Important for the production of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the blood.
            Foods rich in Iron: Red meat, poultry, fish, beans, lentils, tofu, spinach, fortified cereals.
            Iron is a mineral that is essential for the body to make hemoglobin, a protein found in red 
            blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. It is also involved in other 
            important functions such as the production of energy, DNA synthesis, and immune function. 
            Iron can be found in both plant and animal sources, but heme iron from animal sources is more 
            easily absorbed by the body.Deficiency of iron can lead to anemia and other health problems.

            Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that acts as an antioxidant in the body,
            protecting cells from damage by free radicals. It is important for the formation of collagen, a protein
            that gives structure to skin, bones, and other tissues. Vitamin C also plays a role in immune function and 
            the absorption of iron.It is found in a variety of fruits and vegetables, particularly citrus fruits, 
            berries, and leafy greens.

            Protein: Important for the growth and repair of tissues and muscles.
            Foods rich in Protein: Lean meat, fish, poultry, eggs, beans, lentils, tofu, peanut butter.
            Protein is a macronutrient that is important for the growth and repair of tissues and muscles. 
            It is made up of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. The body needs a 
            variety of amino acids, including nine essential amino acids that cannot be produced by the 
            body and must be obtained through the diet. Protein is found in both animal and plant sources, 
            with animal sources providing a complete source of essential amino acids.A balanced intake of
            protein is important for overall health and wellness.
